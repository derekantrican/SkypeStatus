# SkypeStatus

At my company, we use Skype for Business to communicate with each other. I liked the idea of setting my status to “busy” when I left for lunch and “available” when I came back. The problem was, I was always forgetting to set it back because S4B sits in the very bottom corner of my 4 monitor setup. So I made this simple program with 3 main features: a large “Busy” button, a large “Available” button, and a timer. Clicking the busy button sets S4B status to Busy and starts the timer (Available stops the timer and changes the status back). A couple bonus features are that the timer will beep as it gets close to 1 hour (the length of my lunch break), will snap to the mouse (and turn red) when the time is up, and is always-on-top so that it can’t be accidentally hidden by any other windows.

### Bonus features

SkypeStatus not only sets the S4B status, but also interacts with Slack (setting the "status" text) and the [Go Fucking Work Chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/go-fucking-work/hibmkkpfegfiinilnlabbfnjcopdiiig) (pausing it).
